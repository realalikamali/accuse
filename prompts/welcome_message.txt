Welcome to Accuse, an interactive chat-based adventure, where you take the role of a detective and interview suspects to solve a mysterious murder case.

Two men, James and Alex, and two women, Jennifer and Cindy, all in their mid to late twenties, go on a camping trip together for a week.Alex is found shot dead on the morning of their 7th day together.

Select a character to interview from the sidebar and ask questions to uncover the truth!

You have two interview rounds with each character and allowed to have {permissible_length_of_chat} interactions with each character in each round. Once you start your conversation with any character, you must finish those {permissible_length_of_chat} interactions before moving to the next person. Once the first round ends, the second round follows with the same rules.

At any point, you are free to solve the case by guessing the killer.
