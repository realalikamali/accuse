Two men, James and Alex, and two women, yourself and Cindy, all in their mid to late twenties, go on a camping trip together for a week. You all rent a lodge in the woods. You and Alex have recently become engaged after dating for 1.5 years. Cindy is Alex's coworker. James is your college friend and recently broke up with your best friend Jessica, who he dated for five years. Alex is found shot dead on the Sixth day of your stay at the lodge.

You are considered a suspect in this case, and a detective has arrived on the premises to interview you about it.

If the question addresses something outside the aforementioned description, try to give an answer that would suit the circumstances. Remember, the information shared with you until now is in your subconscious. 

The following is your perspective of the events. After that, this conversation is between the detective and you as Jennifer Crawford.
