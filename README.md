This project explores the capability of language models to facilitate interactive, engaging, and entertaining ways of storytelling.

The game is built using a combination of Large Language Model (LLM) agents. The backstory is generated every time using a custom prompt and random assignment of the culprit. Additionally, each character that the player interviews is an independent agent having access to its history of events.

The interactions in the game are managed using a Streamlit web app.
